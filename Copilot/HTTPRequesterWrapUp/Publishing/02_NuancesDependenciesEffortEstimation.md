## Technical Dependencies Analysis

### Core Engine Dependencies

#### Unreal Engine Version Compatibility
```yaml
Current State:
  - Developed on UE 5.4
  - HTTPManager specific implementations
  - Custom utility dependencies

Required Changes:
  - Support UE 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
  - Version-specific API adaptations
  - Backward compatibility testing

Effort Impact: HIGH
Risk Level: MEDIUM
```

#### HTTP Module Dependencies
```cpp
// Current Dependencies (RSSSyncGuidance.cpp analysis)
#include "Http.h"                    // Core HTTP functionality
#include "Json.h"                    // JSON processing
#include "HAL/FileManager.h"         // File operations
#include "Misc/Paths.h"              // Path utilities
#include "Misc/Base64.h"             // Encoding utilities

// Additional Required for Commercial Release

#include "Interfaces/IHttpResponse.h" // Response handling
#include "Interfaces/IHttpRequest.h"  // Request interfaces
```

#### External Function Dependencies
Based on RSSSyncGuidance.cpp analysis, these external functions need refactoring:
```cpp
// Currently External - Need Integration
extern void CreateZip_Structured(TArray<TPair<FString, FString>>, const FString&);

### Final Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Conduct Market Research**: Survey UE5 developers about Git integration needs
2. **Technical Proof of Concept**: Build minimal working plugin prototype
3. **Legal Consultation**: Review licensing and marketplace requirements
4. **Team Assessment**: Evaluate available development resources
5. **Budget Planning**: Finalize investment allocation and timeline

#### Success Maximization Strategies
1. **Start Small**: Begin with single plugin (GitHubSync) to reduce complexity
2. **Community First**: Build user base before monetization
3. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize reliability over feature completeness
4. **Documentation Excellence**: Invest heavily in user experience
5. **Iterative Approach**: Plan for multiple marketplace submission cycles

#### Exit Strategy Considerations
1. **Minimum Viable Product**: Define clear success/failure criteria
2. **Intellectual Property**: Ensure code can be repurposed if needed
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Document all technical decisions and rationale
4. **Community Handoff**: Consider open-source transition if commercial fails
5. **Asset Reuse**: Marketing and documentation assets have independent value

This comprehensive analysis provides the foundation for informed decision-making about proceeding with the HTTP Requester plugin commercialization project. The high complexity and substantial investment required should be carefully weighed against the potential returns and strategic value to your development portfolio.

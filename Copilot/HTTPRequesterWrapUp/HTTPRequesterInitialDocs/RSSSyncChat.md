# RSS Sync Development Chat
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Topic:** Creating a GitHub-based source control system for Unreal Engine 5

## User Request
The user requested help with developing an RSS synchronization system for Unreal Engine 5 that would serve as an internal version control tool using GitHub. The system should:

1. Download branches from GitHub as ZIP files
2. Unpack and analyze file differences using hash comparison
3. Create and compare JSON manifests
4. Synchronize files between local and remote repositories
5. Upload changes back to GitHub

The user wanted:
- Step-by-step beginner-friendly guidance
- Complete function definitions with comments
- Analysis of existing codebase (CustomUtilities.cpp, ZipHandler.cpp, MacrosManager.cpp)
- Implementation likelihood assessment
- Identification of logical mistakes in the approach

## Analysis Performed

### Existing Codebase Review
I analyzed the provided source files and found:

**CustomUtilities.cpp (617 lines):**
- File hash calculation functions (MD5-based)
- Directory hash calculation utilities
- JSON file manipulation functions
- RSS manifest creation functionality
- File dialog utilities
- Strong foundation for file comparison

**ZipHandler.cpp (378 lines):**
- Complete ZIP creation/extraction functionality using minizip-ng
- Structured ZIP handling with relative paths
- Good error handling and logging
- Ready-to-use for branch packaging

**MacrosManager.cpp (694 lines):**
- HTTP request handling for GitHub API
- JSON parsing and manipulation
- Basic GitHub API integration
- File browsing and management utilities

### Implementation Assessment

**Original Estimated Likelihood:** 75%
**Revised Likelihood:** 45% (with simplified scope)

The reduction is due to:
- Underestimated complexity of GitHub API integration
- Missing error handling strategies
- Oversimplified file comparison logic
- Security and authentication challenges

## Deliverables Created

### 1. RSSSyncGuidance.cpp
A comprehensive implementation guide containing:
- 10 main functions following the requested flow
- Detailed comments explaining each step
- Beginner-friendly explanations of complex concepts
- Complete GitHub API integration examples
- Error handling and security considerations
- Example usage and troubleshooting guide

### 2. RSSSyncMistakes.md
Analysis of 12 major logical mistakes and design issues:
- Incomplete GitHub API understanding
- Oversimplified file comparison logic
- Inadequate error handling
- Missing credential management
- Performance and scalability issues
- Architectural improvements needed

### Key Functions Implemented

1. `CreateRSSSyncTempFolder()` - Creates temporary workspace
2. `DownloadBranchFromGitHub()` - Downloads branch via GitHub API
3. `UnpackDownloadedBranch()` - Extracts ZIP files
4. `CreateRemoteManifest()` - Generates manifest from downloaded files
5. `EnsureLocalManifestExists()` - Validates/creates local manifest
6. `CompareManifestsAndFindDifferences()` - Analyzes file differences
7. `ApplyFileChanges()` - Executes synchronization operations
8. `UpdateManifestsAfterChanges()` - Updates manifests post-sync
9. `PackUpdatedBranchToZip()` - Creates upload package
10. `UploadUpdatedBranchToGitHub()` - Pushes changes to GitHub

### Recommendations

**Immediate Steps:**
1. Start with analysis-only mode (no file modifications)
2. Test with small, non-critical repositories
3. Focus on download and comparison first
4. Add upload functionality later

**Learning Path:**
1. Master HTTP client programming in UE5
2. Understand GitHub API authentication
3. Learn asynchronous programming patterns
4. Study Git concepts (commits, trees, blobs)

**Risk Mitigation:**
1. Always backup important files
2. Use version control for the plugin itself
3. Test extensively in isolated environments
4. Implement comprehensive logging

## Technical Challenges Identified

1. **GitHub API Complexity:** Requires understanding of Git objects and commit creation
2. **Authentication:** Secure token management and OAuth2 flow
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Handling simultaneous changes from multiple sources
4. **Performance:** Large repository handling and memory management
5. **Error Recovery:** Robust failure handling and rollback mechanisms

## Next Steps

The user should:
1. Review the RSSSyncGuidance.cpp file for implementation details
2. Study the RSSSyncMistakes.md for design improvements
3. Start with a minimal viable product (download + analysis only)
4. Set up a test GitHub repository for safe experimentation
5. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token for API access

The foundation exists in the current codebase, but significant additional work is needed for a production-ready system. The key is incremental development with thorough testing at each stage.

# GitHubLight Plugin - Project Overview

## Project Vision
GitHubLight is a lightweight, plug-and-play Unreal Engine plugin designed to provide basic GitHub integration for project file synchronization. The plugin serves as a reminder tool for developers to sync their project files rather than a full Git replacement.

## Core Philosophy
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Easy-to-use, plug-and-play functionality
- **Light files only**: Optimized for lightweight project assets
- **Solo development**: Designed for individual developers without team complexity
- **Unreal Engine marketplace focus**: Primary distribution through Epic Games Fab

## Core Functionality
1. Download branch from GitHub
2. Extract content locally
3. Create and compare local/remote manifests
4. Identify file differences
5. Update files (replace existing, add new)
6. Pack updated files into ZIP
7. Upload changes back to GitHub

## Target Market
- Solo Unreal Engine developers
- Small indie game developers
- Developers needing simple version control reminders
- Users preferring lightweight solutions over full Git integration

## Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Unreal Engine Marketplace (Fab)
- Secondary: Patreon, Gumroad, or direct distribution
- Potential: Free distribution for community building

## Development Constraints
- Solo developer with AI assistance
- Budget: Â£20/month for AI agents
- Time investment: 2h daily, 4h weekends
- No external team or professional legal support

## Success Criteria
- Functional MVP for marketplace submission
- Positive user feedback on simplicity
- Stable performance with light files
- Clear documentation and user guides

   - No team backup for knowledge gaps
   - Single point of failure

2. **GitHub API Complexity** (Low-Medium Risk)
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Authentication handling
   - API version changes

3. **UE Plugin Ecosystem** (Low Risk)
   - Plugin certification requirements
   - Compatibility across UE versions
   - Marketplace submission process

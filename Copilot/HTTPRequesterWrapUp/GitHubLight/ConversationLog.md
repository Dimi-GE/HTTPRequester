# GitHubLight Conversation Log
**Project: GitHubLight Plugin Development**
**Date Started: June 18, 2025**

## Conversation Overview
This document tracks all conversations, decisions, and insights related to the GitHubLight plugin development project. Use this to rebuild the development process and maintain continuity.

## Initial Project Clarification (June 18, 2025)

### User's Vision Clarification
The user refined the project scope from complex commercial plugins to lightweight, simple solutions:

1. **Target Platform**: Unreal Engine Marketplace (Fab) as primary distribution
2. **Philosophy**: Simplicity over complexity - plug-and-play solutions
3. **Scope**: Light reminder tools rather than full Git replacements
4. **Development**: Solo developer with AI assistance (£20/month budget)
5. **Timeline**: 2h daily + 4h weekends = 18h/week development time

### Key Decisions Made
- **Plugin Naming**: Changed from "EasyGitHub" to "GitHubLight" (emphasizing lightweight nature)
- **Focus Priority**: GitHubLight first, ZipLight secondary
- **Distribution**: No GitHub publishing requirements, simplified legal considerations
- **Feature Set**: Core functionality only, enhanced features as post-MVP additions

### Core Functionality Defined
1. Download branch from GitHub
2. Extract content locally
3. Create and compare local/remote manifests
4. Identify file differences
5. Update files (replace existing, add new)
6. Pack updated files into ZIP
7. Upload changes back to GitHub

### Enhanced Features Identified
- Streaming download/upload
- Progress bar windows
- Bandwidth management
- Memory management
- Multiple UE version support

## Development Timeline Established
- **Total Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Weeks 1-3) - 35 hours
- **Phase 2**: Core Functionality (Weeks 4-7) - 50 hours
- **Phase 3**: Integration & Polish (Weeks 8-10) - 40.5 hours
- **Phase 4**: Release Preparation (Weeks 11-12) - 27 hours

## Success Probability Assessment: 85%

### Positive Factors
- Existing HTTP and ZIP functionality foundation
- Clear scope definition preventing scope creep
- AI assistance availability
- Well-defined MVP boundaries

### Risk Factors
- Solo development challenges
- GitHub API complexity
- UE plugin ecosystem requirements

## Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Authentication**: GitHub token-based with secure storage
- **HTTP Layer**: Asynchronous requests with retry mechanisms
- **File Management**: Safe temporary operations with cleanup
- **Manifest System**: JSON-based with versioning
- **Progress Tracking**: Unified interface for all operations

## Next Steps
1. Begin Week 1: Project Setup & Research
2. Establish development environment
3. Research GitHub API capabilities
4. Design plugin architecture

## Questions for Future Consideration
1. Specific UE version targeting strategy
2. GitHub API rate limiting handling approach
3. Marketplace submission requirements
4. User feedback collection methods

## Key Insights
- User prioritizes simplicity and functionality over advanced features
- Solo development requires careful scope management
- AI assistance is crucial for success within budget constraints
- Market validation through Fab marketplace is primary success metric

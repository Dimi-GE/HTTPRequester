# Week 3: File Management Foundation
**Phase 1 - Foundation | Week 3 of 12 | 11.7 estimated hours**

## Overview
Build the core file management system that will handle local file operations, temporary directory management, manifest creation, and file comparison utilities. This foundation will support all synchronization operations.

## Primary Objectives
- [ ] Implement local file system operations wrapper
- [ ] Create temporary directory management system
- [ ] Build manifest creation and serialization
- [ ] Develop file comparison and hashing utilities

## Daily Breakdown

**Deliverables:**
- FileSystemManager class
- File operation utilities
- Directory scanning functions

**Code Focus:**
```cpp
// FileSystemManager.h
class GITHUBLIGHT_API UFileSystemManager : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    bool ReadFile(const FString& FilePath, TArray<uint8>& OutData);
    bool WriteFile(const FString& FilePath, const TArray<uint8>& Data);
    TArray<FString> ScanDirectory(const FString& Path, const TArray<FString>& Extensions);
    FFileInfo GetFileInfo(const FString& FilePath);
};
```

### Tuesday (2 hours) - Temporary Directory Management
**Tasks:**
- Implement temporary directory creation and cleanup
- Build safe temporary file operations
- Create directory structure preservation
- Add automatic cleanup mechanisms

**Deliverables:**
- TempDirectoryManager class
- Cleanup automation system
- Directory structure utilities

**Code Focus:**
```cpp
// TempDirectoryManager.h
class GITHUBLIGHT_API UTempDirectoryManager : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    FString CreateTempDirectory(const FString& Prefix);
    bool CleanupTempDirectory(const FString& Path);
    FString GetTempFilePath(const FString& FileName);
    void RegisterForCleanup(const FString& Path);
};
```

### Wednesday (2 hours) - Manifest System Foundation
**Tasks:**
- Design manifest data structure
- Implement JSON serialization for manifests
- Create manifest creation from directory scan
- Build manifest validation functions

**Deliverables:**
- ManifestManager class
- JSON serialization utilities
- Manifest data structures

**Code Focus:**
```cpp
// ManifestManager.h
USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct FFileManifestEntry
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    FString RelativePath;
    FString Hash;
    int64 Size;
    FDateTime LastModified;
};

class GITHUBLIGHT_API UManifestManager : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    bool CreateManifest(const FString& DirectoryPath, FManifest& OutManifest);
    bool SaveManifest(const FManifest& Manifest, const FString& FilePath);
    bool LoadManifest(const FString& FilePath, FManifest& OutManifest);
};
```

### Thursday (2 hours) - File Comparison Utilities
**Tasks:**
- Implement file hashing functions (SHA-256)
- Create file comparison algorithms
- Build difference detection logic
- Add checksum validation utilities

**Deliverables:**
- FileComparison utility class
- Hashing functions
- Difference detection algorithms

### Weekend (3.7 hours) - Integration & Testing
**Saturday (2 hours):**
- Integrate all file management components
- Test complete file scanning and manifest creation
- Validate temporary directory operations
- Performance testing with various file sizes

**Sunday (1.7 hours):**
- Create comprehensive test cases
- Optimize file operations for performance
- Document all file management APIs
- Prepare for Week 4 download implementation

**Weekend Deliverables:**
- Integrated file management system
- Performance benchmarks
- Complete test coverage

## Technical Implementation Details

### File System Safety
- Always validate file paths for security
- Implement atomic file operations where possible
- Add file locking mechanisms for concurrent access
- Proper error handling for permissions and access issues

### Manifest Structure
```json
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "created": "2025-06-18T10:00:00Z",
    "repository": "user/repo",
    "branch": "main",
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "Content/Assets/MyAsset.uasset",
            "hash": "sha256:abc123...",
            "size": 1024,
            "modified": "2025-06-18T09:30:00Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

### File Filtering Strategy
- Support for extension-based filtering
- Size-based filtering (skip large files)
- Path-based exclusions (.git, temp folders)
- Custom filter patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reliable file system operations across different file types
- [ ] Efficient manifest creation and comparison
- [ ] Safe temporary directory management
- [ ] Accurate file hashing and comparison
- [ ] All operations properly error-handled

## Integration Points
- **Week 2 Dependencies**: Uses HTTP layer for error handling patterns
- **Week 4 Preparation**: File operations ready for download/extract
- **Future Integration**: Manifest system used by all sync operations

## Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Large file handling (up to 100MB)
- [ ] Directory with many small files (1000+ files)
- [ ] Unicode filenames and paths
- [ ] File permission scenarios
- [ ] Temporary directory cleanup under various conditions
- [ ] Manifest creation with different file types
- [ ] File comparison accuracy testing

## Performance Considerations
- Use streaming for large file operations
- Implement progress callbacks for long operations
- Optimize directory scanning with selective filtering
- Cache file hashes to avoid recalculation

## Security Considerations
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Secure temporary file creation
- Safe cleanup of sensitive temporary data
- Proper handling of file permissions

## Week 3 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] FileSystemManager class complete and tested
- [ ] TempDirectoryManager with cleanup automation
- [ ] ManifestManager with JSON serialization
- [ ] FileComparison utilities with hashing
- [ ] Integration tests for all components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Security validation complete
- [ ] Week 4 preparation checklist

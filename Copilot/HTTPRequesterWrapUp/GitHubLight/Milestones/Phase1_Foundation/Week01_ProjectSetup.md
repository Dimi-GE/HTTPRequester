# Week 1: Project Setup & Research
**Phase 1 - Foundation | Week 1 of 12 | 11.7 estimated hours**

## Overview
Establish the development foundation, research GitHub API capabilities, and plan the plugin architecture. This week focuses on preparation and understanding rather than implementation.

## Primary Objectives
- [ ] Set up development environment for UE plugin development
- [ ] Research and test GitHub API endpoints
- [ ] Design plugin architecture and component structure
- [ ] Create basic UI mockups for user interface

## Daily Breakdown

### Monday (2 hours) - Environment Setup
**Tasks:**
- Install latest Unreal Engine version
- Set up Visual Studio for plugin development
- Configure GitHub API testing environment
- Create test GitHub repository for development

**Deliverables:**
- Development environment ready
- Test repository created
- GitHub token generated and tested

### Tuesday (2 hours) - GitHub API Research
**Tasks:**
- Study GitHub REST API v4 documentation
- Test basic API calls (repository info, file downloads)
- Research rate limiting and authentication methods
- Document API endpoints needed for the plugin

**Deliverables:**
- List of required API endpoints
- Authentication strategy documented
- Rate limiting considerations noted

### Wednesday (2 hours) - Architecture Planning
**Tasks:**
- Design plugin component architecture
- Plan data flow between components
- Define interfaces and class structures
- Create dependency diagram

**Deliverables:**
- Component architecture diagram
- Interface definitions
- Data flow documentation

### Thursday (2 hours) - UI Planning
**Tasks:**
- Research UE plugin UI best practices
- Create wireframes for plugin interface
- Plan user workflow and interactions
- Design configuration and settings screens

**Deliverables:**
- UI wireframes
- User workflow diagram
- Settings configuration plan

### Weekend (3.7 hours) - Integration Research
**Saturday (2 hours):**
- Research existing HTTP libraries for UE
- Study plugin integration patterns
- Analyze minizip-ng integration options

**Sunday (1.7 hours):**
- Document integration approach
- Create project structure plan
- Prepare development roadmap for Week 2

**Weekend Deliverables:**
- Integration strategy document
- Project structure plan
- Week 2 preparation checklist

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Development environment fully functional
- [ ] GitHub API successfully tested with basic operations
- [ ] Plugin architecture clearly defined and documented
- [ ] UI mockups completed and approved
- [ ] All dependencies identified and documented

## Potential Risks & Mitigation
**Risk: GitHub API complexity**
- *Mitigation*: Start with simple read operations, build complexity gradually

**Risk: UE plugin development learning curve**
- *Mitigation*: Use existing plugin examples, leverage AI assistance for questions

**Risk: Time underestimation**
- *Mitigation*: Focus on research and planning over implementation this week

## Week 1 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Functional development environment
- [ ] GitHub API testing results
- [ ] Plugin architecture documentation
- [ ] UI wireframes and user flow
- [ ] Dependency analysis document
- [ ] Week 2 task preparation

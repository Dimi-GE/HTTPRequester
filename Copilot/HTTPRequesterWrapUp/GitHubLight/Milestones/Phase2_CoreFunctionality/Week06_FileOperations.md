# Week 6: File Operations & Updates
**Phase 2 - Core Functionality | Week 6 of 12 | 13.5 estimated hours**

## Overview
Implement the file update system that safely applies changes identified by the manifest system. This includes backup mechanisms, atomic operations, and validation systems to ensure reliable synchronization.

## Primary Objectives
- [ ] Build safe file replacement and update mechanisms
- [ ] Implement automatic backup system for modified files
- [ ] Create atomic operation framework for rollback capability
- [ ] Develop file validation and integrity checking

# Week 4: Download & Extract Implementation
**Phase 2 - Core Functionality | Week 4 of 12 | 11.7 estimated hours**

## Overview
Implement the core download functionality to retrieve GitHub repository branches and extract content locally. This week bridges the HTTP foundation with file management to create the first major user-facing feature.

## Primary Objectives
- [ ] Implement GitHub branch download using API
- [ ] Create ZIP extraction functionality with minizip-ng
- [ ] Build content validation and verification systems
- [ ] Add basic progress tracking for downloads

## Daily Breakdown

### Monday (2 hours) - GitHub Branch Download
**Tasks:**
- Implement GitHub API calls for branch archive download
- Create download streaming for large repositories
- Add branch selection and validation
- Build download progress callbacks

**Deliverables:**
- GitHubDownloader class
- Branch archive download functionality
- Download progress tracking

**Code Focus:**
```cpp
// GitHubDownloader.h
class GITHUBLIGHT_API UGitHubDownloader : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    bool DownloadBranch(const FString& RepoURL, const FString& Branch, const FString& OutputPath);
    void SetProgressCallback(FDownloadProgressDelegate Callback);
    bool ValidateBranch(const FString& RepoURL, const FString& Branch);
};
```

### Tuesday (2 hours) - ZIP Extraction System
**Tasks:**
- Integrate minizip-ng library for extraction
- Implement safe extraction with path validation

**Code Focus:**
```cpp
// ZipExtractor.h
class GITHUBLIGHT_API UZipExtractor : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    bool ExtractArchive(const FString& ArchivePath, const FString& DestinationPath);
    void SetExtractionFilter(const TArray<FString>& AllowedExtensions);
    FExtractionStats GetExtractionStats();
};
```

### Wednesday (2 hours) - Content Validation
**Tasks:**
- Implement downloaded content verification
- Create file integrity checking
- Build content structure validation
- Add malformed archive handling

**Deliverables:**

- Integrity checking functions
- Structure validation utilities

### Thursday (2 hours) - Progress Tracking Systems
**Tasks:**

- Operation cancellation system
- Progress persistence mechanisms

### Weekend (3.7 hours) - Integration & Optimization
**Saturday (2 hours):**
- Integrate download and extraction pipeline
- Test complete download-to-extraction workflow
- Optimize for various repository sizes
- Implement error recovery mechanisms

**Sunday (1.7 hours):**
- Create comprehensive test scenarios
- Performance optimization for large downloads
- Memory usage optimization
- Prepare manifest generation integration

**Weekend Deliverables:**
- Complete download/extract pipeline
- Performance optimizations
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Technical Implementation Details

### Download Strategy
- Use GitHub's archive API for branch downloads
- Implement chunked downloading for large repositories
- Support for private repositories with authentication
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Extraction Security
- Validate all file paths to prevent zip-slip attacks
- Implement size limits for extracted content
- Filter files by extension and path patterns
- Safe handling of symbolic links and special files

### Progress Tracking Architecture
```cpp
USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct FOperationProgress
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    float OverallProgress;      // 0.0 to 1.0
    FString CurrentOperation;   // "Downloading", "Extracting", etc.
    int64 BytesProcessed;
    int64 TotalBytes;
    int32 FilesProcessed;
    int32 TotalFiles;
};
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Successful download of various repository sizes (1MB to 500MB)
- [ ] Safe and complete extraction of downloaded archives
- [ ] Accurate progress tracking throughout operations
- [ ] Robust error handling and recovery
- [ ] Memory-efficient processing of large repositories

## Integration Points
- **HTTP Layer**: Uses Week 2 HTTP and authentication systems
- **File Management**: Uses Week 3 file operations and temp directories
- **Manifest System**: Prepares for Week 5 manifest comparison
- **UI Integration**: Provides progress data for future UI components

## Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Small repository download (< 10MB)
- [ ] Large repository download (100MB+)
- [ ] Private repository with authentication
- [ ] Corrupted archive handling
- [ ] Network interruption during download
- [ ] Extraction with path conflicts
- [ ] Progress tracking accuracy
- [ ] Memory usage with large files

## Performance Targets
- **Download Speed**: Utilize available bandwidth efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for repositories up to 500MB
- **Extraction Speed**: Process 1000 files/minute on average hardware
- **Progress Updates**: Smooth progress reporting (10+ updates/second)

## Error Handling Scenarios
1. **Network Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff
2. **Authentication Errors**: Clear error messages and re-auth prompts
3. **Corrupted Downloads**: Verify integrity and re-download if needed
4. **Extraction Failures**: Detailed error reporting and partial recovery
5. **Disk Space Issues**: Check available space before operations

## Security Considerations
- Validate repository URLs to prevent SSRF attacks
- Implement zip-slip protection during extraction
- Secure handling of authentication tokens
- Safe temporary file management

## Week 4 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] GitHubDownloader class with full branch download capability
- [ ] ZipExtractor class with security protections
- [ ] ContentValidator for integrity checking
- [ ] ProgressManager for unified progress tracking
- [ ] Complete download-extract pipeline tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for various repo sizes
- [ ] Security validation against common attacks
- [ ] Integration tests with Weeks 2-3 components
- [ ] Week 5 preparation (manifest integration points)

## Notes Section
*Document download performance insights, extraction patterns, and integration discoveries.*

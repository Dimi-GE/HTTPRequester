```

### Change Detection Logic
1. **Hash Comparison**: Primary method for detecting changes
2. **Timestamp Fallback**: Secondary method when hashes unavailable
3. **Size Verification**: Quick check for obvious changes
4. **Conflict Detection**: Identify competing modifications

### Synchronization Planning Algorithm
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Order operations to prevent conflicts
2. **Safety Checks**: Validate operations before execution
3. **Rollback Preparation**: Plan reverse operations for each step
4. **Progress Estimation**: Calculate time and resource requirements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Accurate detection of all file changes (100% accuracy in tests)
- [ ] Efficient comparison of large manifests (1000+ files in < 5 seconds)
- [ ] Clear and actionable difference reports
- [ ] Intelligent conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- [ ] Robust synchronization planning with safety guarantees

## Integration Points
- **File Management**: Uses Week 3 file operations for manifest creation
- **Download System**: Integrates with Week 4 for remote content analysis
- **Future Sync**: Provides plans for Week 6 file update operations
- **UI Integration**: Provides data for user decision interfaces

## Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Large repository comparison (1000+ files)
- [ ] Complex change scenarios (mixed add/modify/delete)
- [ ] Conflict detection accuracy
- [ ] Performance with large manifests
- [ ] Incremental manifest updates
- [ ] Manifest corruption handling
- [ ] Cross-platform path handling
- [ ] Unicode filename support

### Change Scenarios for Testing
1. **Simple Changes**: Single file modifications
2. **Complex Changes**: Multiple interdependent files
3. **Conflicts**: Same file modified in both local and remote
4. **Renames**: Files moved or renamed
5. **Permission Changes**: File permission modifications
6. **Large File Changes**: Modifications to files >50MB

## Performance Targets
- **Comparison Speed**: 1000 files compared per second
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for 10,000 file manifests
- **Report Generation**: < 1 second for typical changes
- **Manifest Loading**: < 500ms for cached manifests

## Advanced Features Implementation

### Smart Conflict Resolution
- Analyze file types for appropriate merge strategies
- Suggest resolution based on file modification patterns
- Provide preview of resolution outcomes
- Support for user-defined resolution rules

### Incremental Updates
- Cache manifest comparison results
- Only re-compare modified directory branches
- Smart invalidation of cached comparisons
- Progressive manifest building for large repositories

## Week 5 Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] ManifestComparator with accurate change detection
- [ ] DifferenceReporter with comprehensive reporting
- [ ] SyncPlanner with operation ordering
- [ ] Conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large repositories

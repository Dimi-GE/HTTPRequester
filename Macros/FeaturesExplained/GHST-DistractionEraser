Hi there,
 
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!
 
Hereâ€™s how you can access this feature:
1. Open your browser.
2. Visit any website (for example, ghostery.com).
3. Click the Ghostery icon to open the quick panel.
4. At the top-center of the panel, you'll see a dropdown showing the current domain name.
5. Click on that dropdown to reveal three additional options.
6. Select "Hide cotent block" option.
 
Try hiding a few elements to get familiar with how it works.
 
Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

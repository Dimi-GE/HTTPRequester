Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

Some activities may not be fully blocked due to their nature. The Ghostery extension monitors browser activity and categorizes trackers accordingly. Trackers labeled as "Modified" may have sent potentially suspicious requests. Our Anti-Tracking Protection removes unique identifiers from certain requests while still allowing them to load, preventing site breakage while maintaining your privacy.

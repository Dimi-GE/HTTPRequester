Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

The Ghostery extension is active by default after installing, and provides its protection on every website. The “Pause for this site” option allows you to temporarily trust a website by adding it to your list of trusted domains. This feature is disabled by default and, when inactive, appears highlighted in blue.

You can toggle it on any website you trust to explore how it works—or try it on ghostery.com as a safe example.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

We havenâ€™t been able to reproduce the issue on our end. Could you, please, confirm if it still persists for you?

If so, we would need a bit more information to assist you better. Please, provide us with the following:
 - Screenshot of the full screen with the Ghostery panel opened when the issue occurs for you (please, remember to hide any personal information before sharing);
 - Your country or region;
 - Do you have additional ad-blockers installed along with the Ghostery?

These details would greatly help in a further investigation. We appreciate your cooperation and will do our best to address the issue promptly.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

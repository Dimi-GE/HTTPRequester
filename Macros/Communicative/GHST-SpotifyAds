Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!
 
We are aware of the current issue with Spotify and our team is actively working on a solution. Due to the complexity of the platform, a stable fix will require some time to develop and test properly.
 
It's a priority for our team, and we appreciate your patience.
 
Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

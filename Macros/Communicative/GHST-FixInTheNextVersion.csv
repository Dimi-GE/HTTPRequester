Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

We are aware of this and have already developed a fix. However, as it requires more than just a filter update, the fix will be included in the next version of the Ghostery extension.

The new release is already in preparation and will be submitted to the browsers this week. It should become available shortly after, once it clears their review processes.

Here for any questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

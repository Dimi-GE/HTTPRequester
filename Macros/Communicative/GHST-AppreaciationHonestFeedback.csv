vHi there,
Thank you for sharing your feedback with us! We truly appreciate your thoughts, as they help us refine the overall user experience and improve the Ghostery extension.

We understand your concern about pop-ups and ads slipping through—this is something we are actively working to address. Ghostery is designed to block most trackers and ads, but we’re aware that some sites may still manage to bypass the blockers.

To help us further improve, could you share any specific websites where you’ve noticed this issue? This would be incredibly helpful as we continue to fine-tune our extension to better meet your needs.

Thank you again for your input, and we hope to keep improving Ghostery to offer a smoother, ad-free experience.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

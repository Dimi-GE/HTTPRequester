Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

While we maintain our own tracker database, our blocking decisions also rely on community-maintained filter lists. You can learn more about them here:
https://github.com/easylist/easylist

If you believe something should be added to a trusted list, you can reach out to their support team or open an issue on GitHub.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

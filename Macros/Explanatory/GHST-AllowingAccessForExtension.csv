Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!
 
To function properly on websites, the Ghostery extension needs certain permissions. The message you're seeing is a general Safari notification letting you know that these permissions are required.
If you'd like Ghostery to work across all websites, it's completely safe to grant access for every site.
 
If you have trusted websites, where you would like to pause the Ghostery extension, you can do it by adding those to the white list. Here are steps to follow:

1. Click on the Ghostery icon to open the panel.
2. Click the three stacked lines to open a menu.
3. Select the “Websites” option.
4. Click “Add” button to call the popup window.
5. Paste the website you would like to add, and select a specific time — 1 hour, 1 day, always.
6. Then click “Save” button.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

The Ghostery extension is available on both desktop and mobile platforms. That said, mobile browsers come with certain limitations when it comes to extension support, and some of those do not allow installing extensions.

As of now, on Android, only a few browsers like Firefox and Kiwi support them. Here are the links:

Firefox for our Desktop and Android users:
• Download Firefox - https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/download/
• Download Firefox for Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en
• Install Ghostery Tracker & Ad Blocker - https://www.ghostery.com/ghostery-ad-blocker

As for our MacOS, iOS and iPad users, we recommend using Safari with Ghostery Tracker & Ad Blocker installed:
• Get Ghostery Tracker & Ad Blocker for Safari - https://www.ghostery.com/ghostery-ad-blocker-safari

You can always find the most up-to-date list of supported browsers on our website: https://www.ghostery.com/ghostery-ad-blocker.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

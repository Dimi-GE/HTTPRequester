Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery! Weâ€™re a small team dedicated to helping you take control of your online privacy.

If you have an account, you've likely used one of our products from the Ghostery Privacy Suite. Ghostery is a free browser extension designed to block unwanted ads, trackers, and other online nuisances, giving you a smoother, faster browsing experience. By preventing websites from tracking your online activity, we help protect your privacy and improve browsing speed.

In addition, Ghostery lets you see who is tracking you on the web, giving you the power to block or manage these trackers as you wish.

For more details about Ghostery and how it works, feel free to visit our official website: www.ghostery.com.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

Ghostery is a browser-based extension focused on blocking trackers, ads, and unwanted scripts. It doesn’t extend to monitor installed software, clean files, or modify your device’s system.

If you're seeing notifications related to [software], we recommend checking if the software is installed. If it is, you may want to review its notification settings and adjust them as needed.

Here for any further questions!
Best,

Hi there,
Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and feedback with us. We truly value the trust and support youâ€™ve shown as a long-time user of the Ghostery Private Browser.

We understand the sense of loss that comes with this change. The Ghostery Private Browser has been a cherished tool for many users, and this decision was not made lightly. In addition to the reasons mentioned in our blog post, which you can find here:

another key factor is the size of our team. We are only eight people, committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality, privacy, and security across the Ghostery Privacy Suite. As a result, we decided to focus on our core expertise: developing industry-leading anti-tracking and ad-blocking tools.

Thank you again for your kind words and understanding, and feel free to reach out with any further questions!

Best regards,
Ghostery Support

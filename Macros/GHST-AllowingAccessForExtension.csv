Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!
 
To be able to work on websites, the extension requires specific permissions. Generally, as any other extension. You can safely allow the access for the extension for every website.
 
If you have trusted websites, where you would like to pause the Ghostery extension, you can do it by adding those to the white list. Here are steps to follow:

1. Click on the Ghostery icon to open the panel.
2. Click the three stacked lines to open a menu.
3. Select the “Websites” option.
4. Click “Add” button to call the popup window.
5. Paste the website you would like to add, and select a specific time — 1 hour, 1 day, always.
6. Then click “Save” button.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

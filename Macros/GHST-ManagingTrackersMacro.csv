Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

There are actually two ways how you can manage the trackers being blocked in the Ghostery extension. Here are steps to follow:
Managing trackers globally:
Open your browser.
Click on the Ghostery icon to open a quick panel.
Click on the 3 stacked lines to open the extension menu.
Click on the “Trackers” option.

From this tab, you have access to all trackers included to block lists.

Managing trackers per website:
Open your browser.
Open a preferred website.
Click on the Ghostery icon to open a quick panel.
Click on the detailed view button.

From this view, you can manage detected trackers across categories and allow or block those for this specific website.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

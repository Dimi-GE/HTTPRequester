Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

You can use the “Pause for this site” feature for temporal pausing the Ghostery extension for the website. Here are steps to follow:
1. Open your browser and visit a website.
2. Click on the Ghostery icon to open the panel.
3. Click “Pause on this site” button.
4. You can also select how long Ghostery should be paused — 1 hour, 24 hours, or always.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

If the Ghostery extension is already installed, please make sure it’s activated and has the necessary permissions enabled. Here’s how:

On iOS:
Open the Settings app on your iPhone.Scroll down and tap Safari.In Safari settings, tap Extensions.Select Ghostery.Make sure “Allow Extension” and “Allow in Private Browsing” are both enabled.Under Permissions, ensure all access is granted.

On macOS:
Open the Safari browser.Go to Safari > Settings (or Preferences).Click the Websites tab.Scroll down to find the Ghostery extension.Set “When visiting other websites” to Allow.


Let us know if that helps or if you run into any issues.

Best,

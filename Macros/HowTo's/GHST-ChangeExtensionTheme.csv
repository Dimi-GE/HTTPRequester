Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

You can change the Ghostery extension appearance by following these steps:
Open your browser.Click on the Ghostery icon to open the panel.Click a burger menu (3 stacked lines).Select My Ghostery option.

In this tab, you can change a Theme color from dark to light, or set it to be system-depended.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

It doesn't work. It says:
YouTube blocking you from watching ad-free videos?
We know you rely on Ghostery for a smooth YouTube experience. Until a more refined solution emerges, hereâ€™s a temporary fix.
1. Allow Ghostery in private windows

If I watch in a Private window, it doesn't block any ads. So what's the sense of even having this extension?

Feature requests:
I would like to be able to enable all ads and trackers by default but then have the option to block specific ones like Facebook or TikTok analitics.


Notes:
 - discuss feature requests on all hands meetings;
 
 - take a look on systems to bring the important domains at the first place in Zendesk.
 - ghostery accounts will be removed;
 
Minimum OS required for Ghostery:

civit.ai is constantly flashing - the extensin tries to remove some elements, which seem to refresh dynamically;

Notes:

The ultimate goal of using statistics is figuring out important domains on flight;

create and describe the feature request in a way I understand how should it work - adding tags to important domains; (keeping in mind there are 10,000 of those)

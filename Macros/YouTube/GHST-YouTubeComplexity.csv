Thanks for getting back to us with such a detailed report—we really appreciate the time and effort you put into gathering this information!

We haven’t been able to reproduce the issue yet, but we’ve shared your findings with our engineering team and are actively looking into it. If you happen to notice anything else, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Also, YouTube is an incredibly complex platform, and resolving this may take some time, even with the entire ad-blocking community working on it. We truly appreciate your patience.

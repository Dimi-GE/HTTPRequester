Hey there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!
 
And thank you for sharing this detail with us. We’re aware of the issue currently affecting most ad blockers on YouTube. YouTube has stepped up its anti-ad-blocking efforts by implementing a new measure, and experimenting with its ad blocking policy. You can find more details in our blog post here:
[What’s Happening with YouTube Ads](https://www.ghostery.com/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads)
 
The entire ad-blocking community—including us—is actively working on updated filters to address it. Here are a couple of temporary workarounds that might help in the meantime:
 - Refresh the page. In some cases, reloading the video page allows it to play properly, bypassing both ads and ad-blocker detection.
 - Use Private/Incognito mode. Opening the video in a private window may help avoid detection, as it prevents cached data or profile-related tracking.
 - Disable or uninstall any other extensions that may interfere with your ad blocker. Some extensions may conflict with your ad blocker or allow ads and trackers to slip through.
 - Try a different browser. Some browsers may have different implementations of Google’s big update, Manifest V3, or different support for ad blocking extensions.
 
YouTube is an incredibly complex platform, and resolving this may take some time, even with the entire ad-blocking community working on it. We truly appreciate your understanding and patience in a meantime.
 
Thanks for staying with us! Your support is much appreciated.
 
Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

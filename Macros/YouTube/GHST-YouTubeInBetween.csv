Hello there,
Thank you for reaching out to Ghostery!

It is most likely that the service providers have found a new way to work around our filters.

Our filters are updated daily by us and the ad-blocking community, so the issue should be resolved with an automatic update of the lists. If the problem persists or becomes more significant and is not resolved within 1–2 days, please report back to us with any additional findings.

Screenshots are always helpful for identifying the issue more effectively. If possible, please send those along (remember to remove any private data before sharing!).

Best,
Ghostery Support

Hello there,
Thank you for reaching out to Ghostery!

YouTube is a complex and ever-evolving platform that often finds new ways to bypass ad-blocking filters.

We update our filters daily—both internally and with help from the ad-blocking community—so most issues are usually resolved automatically. If the problem persists or worsens and isn’t fixed within a day or two, feel free to reach back out with any new findings.

Screenshots are always helpful for diagnosing the issue more effectively. If you can, please include one (making sure to hide any personal information beforehand).

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

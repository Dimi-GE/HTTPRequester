Hello there,
Thank you for reaching out to Ghostery!

It is most likely that the service providers have found a new way to work around our filters.

Our filters are updated daily by us and the ad-blocking community, so the issue should be resolved with an automatic update of the lists. If the problem persists or becomes more significant and is not resolved within 1â€“2 days, please report back to us with any additional findings.

Screenshots are always helpful for identifying the issue more effectively. If possible, please send those along (remember to remove any private data before sharing!).

Best,
Ghostery Support

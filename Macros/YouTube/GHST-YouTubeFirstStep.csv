Hi there, 
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

We havenâ€™t been able to reproduce the issue on our end. Sometimes, these types of issues are tied to A/B testing.

If it still persists, could you try Private mode as a first troubleshooting step and let us know if it helps?

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

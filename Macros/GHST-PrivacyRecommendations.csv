Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

As for private browsing, you might consider using Firefox or Brave—both are well-known for their strong privacy protections. Ghostery works seamlessly with these browsers to help further reduce online tracking. Additionally, the extension also available for mobile devices — for Firefox and Kiwi on Android, and Safari on iOS.
You can install it by visiting the following link:
https://www.ghostery.com/ghostery-ad-blocker

The Ghostery extension is designed to block ads and tracking requests on websites, including those found in emails. It also relies on block lists maintained by a broader community, and new trackers can sometimes take time to be added. If you have found any, you can submit trackers to EasyList or use the respective Ghostery form to report it:

But also note, since it’s browser-based, it protects your online activity but doesn’t extend to software installed on your device. If you’re facing security issues beyond web tracking, we’d recommend reaching out to a privacy or cybersecurity company in your region for tailored assistance.

If you're looking to hide your IP address, we recommend using a VPN. For enhanced email privacy, you may also want to explore anonymous email services like the following:

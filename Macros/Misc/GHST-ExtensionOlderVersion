Hi there,
 
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!
 
You can find the final releases of the Ghostery 8 extension series on our GitHub page here:
https://github.com/ghostery/ghostery-extension/releases?page=5
 
While we generally recommend using the latest version for the best security and performance, we understand that users sometimes have specific needs for older versions. You are also welcome to experiment with earlier versions of Ghostery 10, which are available in the same repository.
 
Please be aware that we can not provide a support for legacy versions.
 
Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

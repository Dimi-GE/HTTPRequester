Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

We have released an update with the newer version of the extension (10.4.28), that should resolve this. Could you, please, update the extension and let us know if you still experience the issue?
Thank you!

Here for any questions!
Best,

Hi there,

Thanks for getting back to us with these details!  

We’ve released a fix for this domain, but it requires an extension update to take effect.  

The new version is currently pending review by the Apple team and will be available as soon as it’s approved.

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

We haven’t had the chance to test this particular configuration ourselves yet. If you’re an experienced user, you’re welcome to give it a try. That said, we generally don’t recommend using multiple ad-blockers simultaneously. Despite those are designed to serve a similar goal, multiple ad-blockers installed often leads to unpredictable behavior.

Here for any further questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support

Hi there,   
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery and your interest in Ghostery Enterprise! 

The regular Ghostery distribution supports Group Policy based configuration.  The managed configuration provides the option to disable setup, disable some user interface elements or add a website to allow-list, but there is no console “for visibility into each agent/extension deployed”.

Below you can find documentation crafted by our engineering team.

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to Ghostery!

If you believe the domain is acting as a tracker, youâ€™re welcome to submit it directly through our tracker submission form here:
https://www.ghostery.com/submit-a-tracker
This helps us continue improving our tracker coverage.

For the future, you can also access the submission form directly in Ghostery by following these steps:
1. Open your browser.
2. Click the Ghostery icon to open the panel.
3. Click the "burger" menu (three stacked lines).
4. Select Submit a new tracker.

Here for any other questions!
Best,
Ghostery Support
